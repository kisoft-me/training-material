### Create a maven-based javalin project, where you set up and start a javalin server, with at least the following:
- **A static file config, allowing you to return assets**
- **An  endpoint that returns a JSON response**
- **An endpoint that returns an HTML response**
- **and echo endpoint that returns whatever body was sent to it**
- **A before middleware/handler that logs the matched path** 
- **An after middleware/handler that logs the user session ID**
